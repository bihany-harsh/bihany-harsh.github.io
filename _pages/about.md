I am **Harsh Bihany**, a undergraduate from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, and have completed my bachelor's in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitk.ac.in). I would soon be joining ETH Zurich, [Department of Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/) for my Master's. I dearly hope everything pans out ðŸ˜Š. I have some very varied interests.

I have delved a bit in the working of the **Linux EXT4 filesystem**. Currently I am working on augmentations on **LoRA** (low-rank adaptation of LLMs). The current work is *under-review*. I am also working on **multi-agent distributed RL** settings over **temporal and epistemic specifications** or other specification bounds. I am also interested in understanding a LLMs ability to align with a given **ethical code of conduct** as well in unearthing the **emergent properties** of modern-day LLMs like ICL (In-context Learning) from a much more mathematical and/or Bayesian perspective.
