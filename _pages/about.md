I am **Harsh Bihany**, a senior undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, and am pursuing my bachelor's in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitk.ac.in). I have some very varied interests.

I have delved a bit in the working of the **Linux EXT4 filesystem**. Currently I am working on augmentations on **LoRA** (low-rank adaptation of LLMs) and also working on **multi-agent RL** settings over **LTL-specifications**.
