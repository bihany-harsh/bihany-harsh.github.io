<!-- ===== Introduction ===== -->

I am **Harsh Bihany**, an undergraduate from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, where I completed my Bachelor’s in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitk.ac.in). I’ll soon be joining ETH Zurich’s [Department of Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/) for my Master’s—fingers crossed everything pans out 😊. My interests span multiple areas in AI, from language models to multi-agent systems.

Currently, I’m working on **multi-agent distributed reinforcement learning** under **temporal and epistemic specifications** (or other specification bounds).
