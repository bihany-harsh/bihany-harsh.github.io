# Reading 2025 and Some More...

I think—and maybe this is just me seeking validation—that, much like a lot of people, I read in spurts and bursts. That’s a rather uncanny way of saying there are stretches of weeks when all I do in my free time is read, followed by a drought lasting a couple of months. This year, I think I've been relatively consistent in that regard. A lot of that can be credited to... well, life. Maybe it's the need to escape what’s been happening lately, or maybe it’s just the comfort of having something familiar to return to. Sitting with my pages (or my beloved Kindle) gives me reason enough to pick up a book. 

We’re already digressing.

Those who know me even a bit know that I primarily indulge in reading a lot of fantasy literature—and I'm a bit of a *zealot* in that aspect. I’m a big, big nerd when it comes to certain fantasy epics. For the past 2–3 years, I’ve been ravaging the Cosmere works by <strong>Brandon Sanderson</strong>. Picture a ranking of top fantasy/sci-fi series: it’s impressive to see an author in the top 10–15, but what if multiple entries belong to the same name? That’s Sanderson. That’s the Cosmere.

In my opinion, his is perhaps the most magnanimous undertaking in modern sci-fi fantasy. I often fall short of words when recommending that people read the original <strong>Mistborn</strong> trilogy (*please read it!*).

We’re digressing again—but don’t worry, my recommendations will come later (and they will constantly be updated).

December 2024 marked a crucial step in Sanderson’s writing journey: the arch-1 finale of his <em>Stormlight Archive</em> arrived in the form of <em>Wind and Truth</em>, his true *magnum opus*. Since then, I’ve read several of his standalone works:

- *The Sunlit Man* — No man is small enough.  
- *Yumi and the Nightmare Painter* — My personal favorite. Simply epic!
- *Tress of the Emerald Sea* — A charming, fairy tale-like story.  

Very recently, I finished the <strong>Mistborn: Wax & Wayne</strong> series. I love you, Wayne! The four books are packed with slick gunfights, world-ending threats, and fan-favorite Sanderlanches. Highly recommend.

Beyond fantasy, I’ve dipped into a bit of <strong>Murakami</strong> too. I recently finished <em>Sputnik Sweetheart</em>. In my opinion, it doesn't quite reach the brilliance of my Murakami favorite—<em>Norwegian Wood</em>—but it still carried that eerie, quiet vibe he’s so known for. I also read his short story collection <em>Men Without Women</em>.

Looking to diversify this year, I’ve picked up <em>गुनाहों का देवता</em> by <strong>Dharamveer Bharati</strong>, and a couple of <strong>Dostoevsky</strong> works—<em>White Night</em> and <em>Crime and Punishment</em>. Sadly, the emotional state I’ve been in lately hasn’t allowed me to finish them. But they remain firmly on my to-do list. I will get through them before September.

## Recommendations

Now onto some recommendations.

If you want to read fantasy (and I’m honestly a bit unsure why you *wouldn’t*—*are you weird or something?*), then I’ve got you covered. If you're unsure and want a light but reliable entry point into the genre, start with the original *Mistborn* trilogy by <strong>Brandon Sanderson</strong>.

But if you're more sure-footed and up for a challenge—something truly epic (and let’s be clear, *Mistborn* is no lightweight)—then dive into <em>The Stormlight Archive</em> by Sanderson or the classic <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> by <strong>J.R.R. Tolkien</strong>, the grand-daddy of all fantasy.

I generally don’t recommend people start with <em>The Eye of the World</em> (Book 1 of the <strong>Wheel of Time</strong> series) by <strong>Robert Jordan</strong>. Not because of any lack of brilliance—it *is* brilliant—but because of the sheer commitment it demands. It's a 14-book epic that took me 2–2.5 years to finish. Worth it? Absolutely. But it’s a long road.

If you're looking for something outside the realm of fantasy, a few fiction picks:

- <em>The Godfather</em> by Mario Puzo — A classic, no questions asked.
- <em>Looking for Alaska</em> by John Green — A great YA novel that still holds emotional depth.

And of course, with recommendations come a few *anti*-recommendations:

- I wouldn't suggest reading anything by Dan Brown. Hold your stone-pelting! He’s a decent writer, sure—but incredibly repetitive. Every book in the Langdon series follows the same structure with different names, except Robert himself.
  
- I’d also personally skip the <strong>The Witcher</strong> series by Andrzej Sapkowski. It’s generally well-loved, and I get why—but for me, it was a bit slow and, at times, just weird. That said, maybe I need to revisit it; my opinion could (should) change.
